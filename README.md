# Quotes
> The unprecedented is necessarily unrecognizable. When we encounter something unprecedented, we automatically interpret it through the lenses of familiar categories, thereby rendering invisible precisely that which is unprecedented.
>
> \- Shoshana Zuboff, [_The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power_][1]

> BALLISTIC MISSLE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.
>
> \- My phone

> A worthwhile exercise would be to delete the word ‘technology’ from our vocabularies in order to see how quickly capitalism's objectives are exposed.
>
> \- Shoshana Zuboff, [_The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power_][1]

> …inefficiency is precisely what shelters us from the inhumanity of Taylorism and market fundamentalism. When inefficiency is the result of a deliberative commitment by a democratically run community, there is no need to eliminate it, even if the latest technologies can accomplish that in no time.
>
> \- Evgeny Morozov, [_To Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism_][2]

> …technology is not and never  can be a thing in itself, isolated from economics and society. This means that technological inevitability does not exist.
>
> \- Shoshana Zuboff, [_The Age of Surveillance Capitalism: The Fight for a Human Future at the New Frontier of Power_][1]
